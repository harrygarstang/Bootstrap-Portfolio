# Bootstrap-Portfolio (Bootcamp Challenge 3)

## Description 
The motivation for this project was to create a portfolio for my work as a developer similar to the previous project, however this time utilising Bootstrap 4.6. 

### Improvements from the previous non-bootstrap portfolio 

* More efficient development timeline with pre-defined Bootstrap classes
* Improved user experience with alignment to UX design principles
* Responsive design for improved accessability on different devices
* Simplified codebase and easier customization options with Bootstrap styles and components

### What I have learnt 

* The benefits of using Bootstrap for faster and more efficient development
* How to utilize Bootstrap styles and components to create a responsive and accessible website
* The importance of aligning with UX design principles for improved user experience
* The value of pre-defined classes and customizable options in simplifying the codebase and facilitating customization.
